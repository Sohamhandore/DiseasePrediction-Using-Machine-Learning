# Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a web-based Disease Prediction system designed to predict possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. The frontend is built with **HTML** and **CSS** to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the backend uses a Machine Learning model for accurate predictions.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for symptom input
- Predicts diseases based on symptoms using Machine Learning
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Easily extendable with more symptoms and diseases

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Machine Learning: Python (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or other)
- Backend:(using Flask, Django, Node.js, etc.)
- 
## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install dependencies (example for Python backend):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Frontend and backend server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend npm run dev
and in another terminal cd backend python app.py
   ```

5. Open the frontend by opening `index.html` in your browser or accessing the server URL.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface.
2. upload pdf of blood report
3. Click Predict.
4. View the predicted disease(s).

## How It Works

* The user inputs symptoms in the frontend form.
* These symptoms are sent to the backend.
* The backend runs the Machine Learning model to predict diseases.
* The prediction is sent back and displayed to the user.

## Future Enhancements

* Add more symptoms and diseases to improve accuracy
* Implement deep learning models for better prediction
* Add user authentication and history tracking
* Create API endpoints for integration with other apps
